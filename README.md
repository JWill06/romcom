# RomCom  

### Abstract:

This project is a website that procedurally generates romance novel covers, allows users to save covers they like, and create their own covers with user submitted data. The goal of this website is to provide writers struggling block to kickstart their next project idea, or maybe just have fun and blow off some steam by generating useful encapsulations of an idea or funny terrible ones depending on their luck.

### Installation Instructions:

1. Open the following link: https://github.com/JWill06/romcom
2. Click on Fork Repository or simply clone it to their machine if they don't plan on making changes and just want to use the website locally using HTTPS: https://github.com/JWill06/romcom.git or SSH: git@github.com:JWill06/romcom.git.
3. Use terminal command (or other prefered method) **open index.html** within the romcom directory to load the website.

### Context:

This project took roughly 10 hours of combined work from both team mates, though much of that was concurrent on work divided amongst each partner. This is the 2nd week of Mod 1 project.

### Contributors:

Jordan Williamson (PM) : @JWill06
Gwyneth Patrick : @gwynethpatick985

### Learning Goals:

The learning goals of this project were to practice and hone javascript knowledge in an applied setting of website development, understanding how script interacts and is handled by HTML and CSS, and creating an integrated website that uses of all of these skills. We utilized git branches to work separately before merging them over huddle on slack.

### Wins + Challenges:

Wins: 
1. We were able to communicate as a team and build the project together by splitting up tasks that we were weaker in to build more experience/knowledge. And when we met to discuss our work we took ample time to explain the code we wrote to the other partner so it could easily be worked with and understood by eachother.
2. We were able to really on eachothers knowledge to get over any roadblocks that we had when we separated portions of the iterations and ultimately made the website fully functional.

Challenges:
1. We struggled at a couple points taking proper POMS and breaks in a desire to get done with the project early, but we overcame it being too severe of an issue by keeping eachother accountable when we noticed it was starting to affect out mental clarity.

2. It took us a second to figure out what work was and wasn't required of us in the saved covers section, and ended up over thinking it a bit as a "school project" rather than a website that needs to get made. But we did eventually realize this and analyzed the CSS file to see what formatting had been provided for the "mini covers" and overcame this roadblock.
